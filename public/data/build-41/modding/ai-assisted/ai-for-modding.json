  "content": "# AI Tools for Modding\n\n## Overview\n\nAI assistants have changed game modding. You no longer need to be a programmer to create mods - you need to be good at describing what you want. This guide introduces AI tools and how they fit into your modding workflow.\n\n## What AI Can Do for Modding\n\n| Task | How AI Helps |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Write code** | Generate Lua scripts from descriptions |\n| **Explain code** | Break down vanilla code line by line |\n| **Fix errors** | Analyze error messages and suggest fixes |\n| **Convert formats** | Turn ideas into proper script syntax |\n| **Find examples** | Locate similar code in vanilla files |\n| **Debug logic** | Trace through code to find issues |\n\n## Popular AI Tools\n\n### ChatGPT (OpenAI)\n\n**Best for:** General coding questions, explaining concepts\n\n- Free tier available\n- Good at Lua syntax\n- Can analyze code you paste\n- Web interface at chat.openai.com\n\n### Claude (Anthropic)\n\n**Best for:** Long code analysis, detailed explanations\n\n- Free tier available\n- Handles large code blocks well\n- Thoughtful, detailed responses\n- Web interface at claude.ai\n\n### GitHub Copilot\n\n**Best for:** In-editor code completion\n\n- Paid subscription\n- Integrates directly into VS Code\n- Suggests code as you type\n- Learns from your project context\n\n### Local Models (Ollama, LM Studio)\n\n**Best for:** Privacy, offline use\n\n- Free, runs on your computer\n- No internet required\n- Varying quality depending on model\n- More technical setup required\n\n## What AI Is Good At\n\n### Generating Boilerplate\n\n**You say:** \"Create a basic PZ item definition for a flashlight\"\n\n**AI generates:**\n```\nmodule Base {\n    item Flashlight {\n        DisplayCategory = Equipment,\n        Type = Normal,\n        DisplayName = Flashlight,\n        Icon = Flashlight,\n        Weight = 0.5,\n        Tooltip = Tooltip_Flashlight,\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explaining Vanilla Code\n\n**You paste:** A complex Lua function\n\n**AI explains:** Each line's purpose, why certain patterns are used, what the function returns\n\n### Fixing Syntax Errors\n\n**You paste:** Code with a missing comma\n\n**AI responds:** \"Line 5 is missing a comma after `Weight = 0.5`. The corrected line should be: `Weight = 0.5,`\"\n\n### Converting Ideas to Code\n\n**You say:** \"I want a recipe that turns 3 planks and 5 nails into a wooden crate, requiring a hammer\"\n\n**AI generates:**\n```\nrecipe Make Wooden Crate {\n    Plank=3,\n    Nails=5,\n    keep Hammer,\n\n    Result:WoodenCrate,\n    Time:100.0,\n    Category:Carpentry,\n}\n```\n\n## What AI Struggles With\n\n### PZ-Specific Knowledge\n\nAI doesn't have deep knowledge of Project Zomboid's specific systems. It might:\n- Use wrong function names\n- Suggest deprecated approaches\n- Miss PZ-specific conventions\n\n**Solution:** Always verify AI suggestions against vanilla code or wiki documentation.\n\n### Complex Game Logic\n\nAI can write code structure but may not understand:\n- How PZ's event system works\n- Client vs server separation\n- Multiplayer synchronization\n\n**Solution:** Use AI for syntax help, but understand the game systems yourself.\n\n### Recent Changes\n\nAI training data has a cutoff date. Build 42 features won't be in older models.\n\n**Solution:** Specify \"Build 41\" in your prompts and verify against current game files.\n\n## Setting Up Your Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Choose Your Tool\n\nFor beginners, start with **ChatGPT** or **Claude** - both have free tiers and web interfaces.\n\n### Step 2: Keep Reference Material Ready\n\nHave these open while modding:\n- Vanilla script files (for correct syntax)\n- This wiki (for PZ-specific info)\n- Your AI tool of choice\n\n### Step 3: Learn to Iterate\n\nAI rarely gets things perfect on the first try. The workflow is:\n\n1. Describe what you want\n2. Get AI's response\n3. Test in game\n4. Report errors back to AI\n5. Refine until it works\n\n## Example Conversation\n\n**You:** \"I want to create a recipe in PZ Build 41 that lets players craft a molotov cocktail from a bourbon bottle, ripped sheets, and a lighter. The lighter should not be consumed.\"\n\n**AI:** \"Here's a recipe definition for that:\n\n```\nmodule Base {\n    recipe Make Molotov {\n        WhiskeyFull,\n        RippedSheets=2,\n        keep Lighter,\n\n        Result:Molotov,\n        Time:50.0,\n        Category:Survivalist,\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNote: I used `WhiskeyFull` as that's the actual item ID for bourbon in vanilla PZ. The `keep` keyword ensures the lighter isn't consumed.\"\n\n**You:** \"I get an error - Molotov doesn't exist as an item\"\n\n**AI:** \"You're right - you'll need to either use an existing vanilla item ID or create the Molotov item first. In vanilla PZ, the molotov is likely called something else. Let me check common naming patterns...\"\n\nThis back-and-forth is normal and productive!\n\n## Tips for Better Results\n\n1. **Be specific** - \"PZ Build 41 recipe\" not just \"game recipe\"\n2. **Provide context** - Paste relevant code you're working with\n3. **Ask for explanations** - Understanding helps you fix future issues\n4. **Verify everything** - Test in-game, compare to vanilla\n5. **Iterate** - First response is rarely final\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n1. **AI accelerates modding** but doesn't replace understanding\n2. **ChatGPT and Claude** are free and beginner-friendly\n3. **Always verify** AI output against vanilla code\n4. **Iterate through conversation** - refine until it works\n5. **AI is a tool**, not a magic solution",
