# Sandbox options: vehicles

> **Generated from the code.** This page is generated from Build 9.99 (revision 0f0f0f0f0f) by `npm run kb:gen-server`, not written by hand. When the game updates we re-extract the data and run it again, so the page always matches one exact build. How it is made is on [the handbook's first page](/pz/build-42/server/getting-started/running-a-server#how-these-pages-are-made).

How many cars there are, their fuel, condition, locks and alarms, and what a crash does.

> **Proof:** Code. zombie.SandboxOptions (each option's declaration: name, type, Java default, range, translation keys), media/lua/shared/Sandbox/*.lua (the presets; the Apocalypse values are the defaults, loaded by the SandboxOptions constructor), media/lua/shared/Translate/EN/Sandbox.json (labels, descriptions, choices), media/lua/client/OptionScreens/ServerSettingsScreen.lua (the settings pages), and the read sites named under each option. Build 9.99 (revision 0f0f0f0f0f).
